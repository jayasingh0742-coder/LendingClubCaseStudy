## General Information
- In the recent years, certain realities are highly visible in the Consumer Finance Company. The company is obliged to lend loans to customers, flying in loan application. Although, post thorough verification of the applicant has been done, there are situations where the company has to encounter the “defaulters” or “charged-off” candidates, who are unlikely to repay their loan. Thus, such failures to fulfill leads to financial loss for the company.

- Project purpose:
	Identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default which can be used to take appropiate actions
- Dataset : 
	Dataset provided for analysis is a loan dataset with 39717 entries and 111 columns



## Conclusions
- Post entire analysis, it is noticed that there are feature variables that can aide financial companies to identify defaulters
- Although these feature variables are marginally differentiate between fully charged and charge off categories, they do have peak point identification factors such as lending out minimal interest rates to applicants or based on grades of applicants, more term can be granted or based on demography and its spending power, applicants could have lesser stringent obligations to pay off their loans including customer with more number of accounts.
- Customers with higher loan amount and loan taken for small business ,belonging to grade E and F are risky customers.
