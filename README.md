## General Information
- The company is a finance company specializing in personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss. Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
- Project purpose:
	Identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default which can be used to take appropiate actions
- Dataset : 
	Dataset provided for analysis is a loan dataset with 39717 entries and 111 columns
